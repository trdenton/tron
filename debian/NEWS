cron (3.0pl1-133) unstable; urgency=medium

  * As a reasonable protective measure, crontabs are now limited to 1000 lines
    in length per crontab.
    The maintainers find it very unlikely that longer crontabs exist; however,
    if you do have a use case, please file a bug report with a brief rationale,
    and we will consider raising this limit.
